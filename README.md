xml-stream-parser is a GO library to parse xml files. It is written to addres the performance [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21823) in default xml package.

### Install

### Usage

Let say you have following xml and you want to loop over book as a stream
and parse various elements and attributes

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore>
   <book ISBN="10-000000-001">
      <title>The Iliad and The Odyssey</title>
      <price>12.95</price>
      <comments>
         <userComment rating="4">Best translation I've read.</userComment>
         <userComment rating="2">I like other versions better.</userComment>
      </comments>
      <description>Homer's two epics of the ancient world, The Iliad & The Odyssey, tell stories as riveting today as when they were written between the eighth and ninth century B.C.</description>
   </book>
   <book ISBN="10-000000-999">
      <title>Anthology of World Literature</title>
      <price>24.95</price>
      <comments>
         <userComment rating="3">Needs more modern literature.</userComment>
         <userComment rating="4">Excellent overview of world literature.</userComment>
      </comments>
      <description>The anthology includes epic and lyric poetry, drama, and prose narrative, with many complete works and a focus on the most influential pieces and authors from each region and time period.</description>
   </book>
</bookstore>
```

you can use the library like so

```go
//First open your file and create reader. You can also use gzip file check tests
file, _ := os.Open("books2.xml")
defer file.Close()
br := bufio.NewReader(file)

// then create  following channel to read your parsed data from.
var resultChannel = make(chan XMLEntry)

// init parser
var parser = XMLParser{
R:          br, 
// define tag to loop over
LoopTag:    "book",
OutChannel: &resultChannel,
// you can skip tags that you are not interested it relatively speeds up the process
SkipTags:   []string{"description"}, 
}

// start parsing with a go routine
go parser.Parse()

// and finally read parsed data 
for book := range resultChannel {
// print ISBN value
isbn := book.Attrs["ISBN"]
fmt.Println(isbn)

// print title
title := book.Elements["title"][0].InnerText
fmt.Println(title)

// print a user commet which has rating 4
// basically you can walk on all the sub nodes if you have
for _, userComments := range book.Elements["comments"][0].Childs {
	for _, comment := range userComments {
		if comment.Attrs["rating"] == "4" {
			  // print the user comment
			  fmt.Println(comment.InnerText)
			}
		}
	}
}
```
